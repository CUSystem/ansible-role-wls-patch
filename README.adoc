# Ansible Role: wls-patch

Copy over and prepare WLS system for patching.
Someone specific since patching names and files can vary so widely. 
Designed primarly for an organization with a binary artifact repository, but should also work for folks who copy files over using Ansible.

## Requirements

Linux, RHEL or CentOS 7 preferred but 6 supported.

## Dependencies

None.

== Example requirements.yml

----
  - src: https://github.com/staylorx/ansible-role-wls-patch
    version: master
    name: staylorx.wls-patch
----

Install with

  sudo ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml

## Example Playbook

A 12.2.1.2 example shown but I'll update with older patching as I can.
